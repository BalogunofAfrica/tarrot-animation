# Tarrot Example

Tarrot example based on William Candillon's ["Can it be done in React Native"](https://github.com/wcandillon/can-it-be-done-in-react-native "Github Link") series.

# Fixed Elevation issue on Android

Fixed elevation issue by using [React Native Shadow 2](https://github.com/SrBrahma/react-native-shadow-2 "Shadow Component") to give same shadow effect for both platforms.

Shadow styles are applied directly to the Shadow component.

# Running Example

Clone the repo and run:

```
yarn or npm install
```

to install dependencies, then run:

```
yarn start or npm start
```

to start the development server.
